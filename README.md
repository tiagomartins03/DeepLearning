Deep Learning Algorithms
In this folder, you will find implementations of various Deep Learning algorithms, developed for different tasks and neural network architectures. Each algorithm has been implemented using popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Available Models:
Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the simplest neural network models, consisting of a single layer of neurons. It is commonly used for binary classification tasks and can be extended to more complex problems.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in computer vision tasks, where the convolutional structure allows efficient extraction of features from images. They have been successfully applied to problems such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or text. They have connections that allow information to be propagated over time, being useful in tasks such as time series prediction, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

Unsupervised Networks
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
Self-Organizing Maps are an unsupervised learning technique used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. They are often used for exploratory data analysis and clustering.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Generative Adversarial Networks are a type of neural network architecture used to generate synthetic data that resembles a given input dataset. They consist of two models, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained together through competition to generate realistic data.

Each folder in this collection contains examples of implementations of these algorithms, along with usage instructions and relevant references. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute your own models and improvements!
